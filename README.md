*NOTE: The **Bedding traces to S&D** tool estimates OrientationConfidenceDegrees (OCD). While I believe the estimation procedure is formally correct, I suspect it underestimates OCD by a factor of 2 or 3. This likely reflects a failure to account for covariance in input data generated by digitizing linear traces on a continuous surface.*
